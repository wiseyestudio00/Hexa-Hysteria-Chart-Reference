## Show Character
```
show Esti.1@Body.1@Normal.2@Action
```
This shows 2.png in Action Folder over 1.png in Normal folder over 1.png in Body.folder

Should the initial label just be the name of the file?

Better question: why do we need label?
- To enable Jump command
That makes sense

Then what is the point of making the initial label in the file itself, but not the name of the file?
- No reason, really.
